            The Assembled web design affects both usability and content
            effectiveness. The user experience is created to be attractive,
            comprehensible, accessible, and interesting by using a logical
            layout, typefaces, colors, responsiveness, and a simple user
            interface. Such design elements also ensure good user satisfaction;
            therefore, they are a very crucial part of the web designing
            process.

            The user interface looks fresh & elegant thanks to the white body,
            combined with black fonts while the black headers and footers with
            white writing make it classy and sophisticated. This choice of color
            makes our webpage more attractive and simpler which motivates and
            attracts multiple types of users towards it. The colors are visually
            appealing through there high contrast for readability and product
            images. The general design scheme is very professional and tech. It
            makes the website more attractive and interesting to users and
            encourages them to visit it more often.

          <div class="content-para">
            Maintainability of a website is determined by the quality and the
            structure of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The html elements in our
            markup are differentiated through a combination of unqiue ids and
            reusable classes. By creating seperate stylesheets for each webpage,
            we have ensured that we will not face any difficulties while making
            any future upgrades. We have also aggregated our website's
            functionality into seperate external files where each script
            contains functions related to the features they implement in our
            webpage, this provides feasibility in making enhacements in the
            current features and also helps in appending new features for our
            users. This structure of files and code thus, maximises developer
            maintainability for future upgrades
